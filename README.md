# Pirate's Keel Public Repository

This is public repo of game I made for itch.io - https://checkenginestudios.itch.io/pirates-keel

Game has simple premise - you're pirate on your ship. You need to destroy other ships with your cannons. Roadmap of the project can be found here: https://trello.com/b/ttnlSx1x/pirates-keel-roadmap , but I can't guarantee that this public part of the project will be in sync with main release. 
Main goal of this repo is to share with gamedev community ideas, code samples, something you can inspect and learn upon. Whether it'll be "dude I can do better" or "that's a neat trick" ;)

Please bear in mind that I can't share publicly many of the assets that I used for the game as Unity Asset Store licence forbids me to it. I have put all the links to the Unity Asset store in file ASSETS.md so you can use them as you wish. Also, bear in mind if you want to clone this repo, use git cloning feature as this projects uses git lfs. 

Game was made using Unity version 2020.1.6f1. All files in this repo are licenced under BSD 3-Clause, with the exception of those listed in credits file. If I forgot, missinterpreted or missused any asset that is the part of the project, please let me know, either via emailing me directly, or using issues tab of Github
