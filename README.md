# Pirate's Keel Public Repository

This is public repo of game I made for itch.io - 

Game has simple premise - you're pirate on your ship. You need to destroy other ships with your cannons. Roadmap of the project can be found here:   , but I can't guarantee that this public part of the project will be in sync with main release. 
Main goal of this repo is to share with gamedev community ideas, code samples, something you can inspect and learn upon. Whether it'll be "dude I can do better" or "that's a neat trick" ;)

Please bear in mind that I can't share publicly many of the assets that I used for the game as Unity Asset Store licence forbids me to it. I will however put list of all the assets I used in my game, so you can use them as you need to. 

Game was made using Unity version 2020.1.6f1. All assets are licenced under BSD 3, with the exception of those listed in credits file. If I forgot, missinterpreted or missused any asset that is the part of the project, please let me know, either via emailing me directly, or using issues tab of Github
